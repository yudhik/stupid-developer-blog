If you know about **[Dunning-Kruger effect](https://g.co/kgs/acMHgU)** you will understand the meaning of this blog. To simplify the explanation, you can simply watch **[This video](https://youtu.be/GJz66wm95-M)**

My motivation to create this blog is because I feel too tired to repeat and repeat again the new developers by teaching them about the fundamental software development. 

Hopefully with this blog not only my colleagues but lot of people can learn and grow. Remember think you a smart developer is only for them who think they have enough things to learn. 

So, enjoy and take your time in this blog.
